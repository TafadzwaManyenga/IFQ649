# IFQ649
##  Advanced Networks, IoT

This unit is an extension to the deep-dive of networks and OSI from a QUT Postgraduate accreditation. The repo captures the project to assess the use of IoT devices and determining the design and security considerations required when scoping IoT networks. In the real-world these applications can be for sensors, actuators, and buzzers used for smart agriculture, industrial control systems (ICS and SCADA), enterprise solutions, and environmental real-time tracking (Air Quality, Water Control, Meteorology etc.).
